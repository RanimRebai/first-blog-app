# Full-Stack Blog Web Application

This is a full-stack blog web application built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **EJS** for the front-end. The project allows users to create, edit, and view blog posts dynamically.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays all blog posts with the option to see more details.
- **Create Post**: Form to create a new blog post.
- **Edit Post**: Option to edit a specific blog post after selecting it from the list.
- **Post Management**: You can add a title, object, and description to each post.
- **Real-time Validation**: Ensures that all fields are filled before submitting a post.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: For now, posts are stored in-memory. You can implement persistent storage like MongoDB or MySQL for further enhancement.
